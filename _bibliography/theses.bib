  title={Stability and Exploitation in Differentiable Games},
  author={A. Letcher},
  pdf={msc_thesis.pdf},
  abstract={While machine learning has traditionally focused on optimising single loss functions, a growing number of algorithms deal with multiple interacting goals, from GANs to multi-agent RL. Naively transposing gradient descent has been shown to fail, while state-of-the-art proposals are tailored to specific applications (e.g. two-player zero-sum games) or lack strong theoretical guarantees. We provide a unified approach to this problem and prove local convergence of Consensus Optimisation, Symplectic Gradient Adjustment and lookahead in all differentiable games. Learning with Opponent-Learning Awareness (LOLA) takes a different approach by shaping and exploiting opponent learning, reaching better equilibria and outperforming previous methods. On the flip side, we construct the first example where this backlashes in self-play, producing arrogant behaviour and poor losses. We address and solve this catch-22 with a new algorithm named Stable Opponent Shaping (SOS), inheriting strong convergence guarantees from lookahead and shaping capacity from LOLA. We obtain convergence of LOLA to equilibria in two-player zero-sum and n-player cooperative games as a corollary.},

  title={Algebraic Features of Multiple Zeta Values},
  author={A. Letcher},
  pdf={bsc_thesis.pdf},
  abstract={This report aims to present multiple zeta values, a topic which has witnessed a rich mathematical revival and profound breakthroughs in recent years, yet remains cloaked with long-standing conjectures. It is aimed at the undergraduate/first-year postgraduate reader, but we hope that it will be relevant to anyone with curiosity for the subject. The first three chapters introduce the algebraic structure of multiple zeta values in a detailed, rigorous and approachable way. Chapter 4 investigates interpolation (as recently introduced by Yamamoto) and presents a few independent results on the topic. The final chapter gives a glimpse of a more sophisticated approach involving the theory of motives, which has borne powerful results in recent years.},
