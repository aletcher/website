Looking to start a PhD in 2020/21. Ideally I'd like to work in an area with both 'abstract' mathematics and application area. Maybe something in theoretical machine learning, game theory or topology. I also like the work of Judea Pearl on moving from curve fitting to causal inference. Please e-mail me if you have any pointers or suggestions!

Previously I worked as a modelling specialist for <a href="https://www.l2f.ch" target="blank">L2F</a>, a start-up developing predictive software using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning" target="blank">ML</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_data_analysis" target="blank">TDA</a>. Before that I studied pure mathematics with a <a href="https://aletcher.github.io/assets/pdf/bsc_thesis.pdf" target="blank">bachelor thesis</a> in number theory, along with theoretical CS in my <a href="https://aletcher.github.io/assets/pdf/bsc_thesis.pdf" target="blank">master thesis</a> on multi-agent learning.

Currently taking a break from research to follow a professional course in contemporary/urban dance.
