Looking to do a PhD after some time at L2F. I'd like to find an area where 'abstract' mathematical understanding really complements and improves its applications in the real world. Maybe something like TDA or manifold learning? Feel free to e-mail me with any suggestions!

Otherwise I love climbing, dancing, cold showers, trees and music. Possibility of throwing away this cerebral life and trying something more heartful. :)
