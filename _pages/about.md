Looking to start a PhD in 2020. I'd like to find an area where 'abstract' mathematical understanding really complements and improves its applications in the real world. Maybe something in game theory, TDA or manifold learning? Please e-mail me if you have any suggestions!

Otherwise I love climbing, dancing, cold showers, trees and music. Looking forward to taking a break from cerebral life this year with a training program in contemporary dance. :)
