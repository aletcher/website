Looking to start a PhD in 2020. Ideally I'd like to work in an area with both 'abstract' mathematics and application area. Maybe something in theoretical machine learning, game theory or topology. I also like the work of Judea Pearl on moving from curve fitting to causal inference. Please e-mail me if you have any pointers or suggestions.

Otherwise I like climbing, music, cold showers and trees. Looking forward to taking a break from cerebral life this year with a professional training program in contemporary dance. :)
