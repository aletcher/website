<h3 class="code">{{"Learning in Differentiable Games"}}</h3>

Over the last few years, different communities (multi-agent, optimization & control) have worked on learning in differentiable games. I recently released a <a href="https://github.com/aletcher/stable-opponent-shaping" target="_blank">notebook</a> implementing Stable Opponent Shaping (<a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=SyGjjsC5tQ" target="_blank">SOS</a>) along with a firework of other methods (LOLA, LA, SGA, CO, EG, CGD, LSS). A number of games including matching pennies and the iterated prisonerâ€™s dilemma are included, but feel free to define any n-player game and compare the algorithms yourself.
